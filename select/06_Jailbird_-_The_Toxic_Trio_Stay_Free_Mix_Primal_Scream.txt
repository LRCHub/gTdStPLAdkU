Scratchin' like a tom cat
Got a monkey on my back
I'm gonna push and pull
And howl like wolf
And drive my cadillac

I've got medication, honey
I've got wings to fly
I've got horse hoof tea
To buzz you like a bee
Gonna blind the evil eye

Push and pull with me
Funky jammin' free
Walk it like you talk it, honey
Strut your funky stuff
Come on...

I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come in my kitchen
I've got hop head soup for grease
Just shake your hips
And let it rip
And let the spirit free

Ride on baby, ride on
Let your crazy horses loose
Give it all you got
When you're hot to trot
And wave bye bye to the blues

Shake it to the east
Shake it to the west
Shake it with the very one
That you love the best
Come on...

I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

All right

I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
I'm yours, you're mine
Gimme more of that Jailbird pie
